Implement comprehensive vertex selection with move and delete operations

**New Infrastructure:**
- Created VertexHandle class to uniquely identify vertices (entity + index)
- Extended ISelectionService with vertex selection capabilities:
  * SelectedVertices collection
  * HitTestVertex() for vertex picking
  * SelectVerticesInBox() for box selection
  * SelectVertex(), DeselectVertex(), ClearVertexSelection()
  * ToggleVertexSelection()
  * VertexSelectionChanged event

**SelectMode Enhancements:**
- Added "Filter: Vertices Only" context menu option
- Vertex hit testing and selection when filter is active
- Visual vertex handles (6px squares) drawn for all vertices
- Selected vertices highlighted in orange
- Box selection support for vertices
- Delete vertices operation (maintains minimum vertex count)
- Dynamic status prompts showing vertex vs entity count
- Context menu actions for both entity and vertex selections

**Vertex Operations:**
- Delete selected vertices (Del key)
  * Maintains minimum 2 vertices for polylines
  * Maintains minimum 3 vertices for boundaries
  * Groups deletions by entity for efficiency
  * Processes indices in descending order to avoid index shifts
  
**Visual Feedback:**
- Vertex handles drawn as 6px blue squares when in vertex mode
- Selected vertices shown as 6px orange squares
- Handles scale correctly with camera zoom
- Clear visual distinction from entity selection

**Integration:**
- MainWindow subscribes to VertexSelectionChanged events
- Automatic view updates on vertex selection changes
- Seamless switching between entity and vertex selection modes

This enables precise vertex-level CAD operations including individual vertex 
selection, multi-selection via box, visual feedback, and deletion - essential 
for detailed geometry editing workflows.
